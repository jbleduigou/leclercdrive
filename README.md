# leclercdrive

## Description
This is a Chrome extension for sorting prices in the Leclerc Drive website.

## Deprecated
The Leclerc Drive website is now providing a sorting mechanism itself.
Therefore this Chrome extension is no longer supported and no longer works with the website.
The repo will remain online though.
